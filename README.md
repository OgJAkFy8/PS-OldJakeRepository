# PowerShell_VM-Modules
This is starting as a place to build out PowerShell modules to help with admin of VM's.  

It has strayed a bit from the beginning, The current list of scripts are most simpliy an upload of working and partly working scripts.  I would like to clean them up and house them in this common location for future use.

1. Upload Files
1. Pull out common Functions to independent modules
1.Clean up the total formation for easy transportation
